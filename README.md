## ðŸ’¡ System Architecture
The frontend interacts with the backend in a seamless way to provide a real-time email management experience. The flow is as follows:

- User Authentication:
The frontend facilitates OAuth2 authentication for Gmail accounts, allowing users to connect their accounts securely.

- Fetching Emails:
Emails are fetched from the backend asynchronously, with WebSockets providing real-time updates to the inbox.

- Categorization and Summarization:
Emails are categorized using Gemini AI and then sent to the frontend for display. The user can click to summarize emails with AI.

- Round-Robin Account Fetching:
The frontend lets users manage multiple Gmail accounts, with the backend fetching and categorizing emails from each account in a round-robin manner.

### ðŸ”„ Real-Time Sync with WebSockets
The frontend stays synced with the backend through WebSockets. As soon as an email is categorized, the frontend immediately reflects that change, ensuring a zero-lag experience.

### âš¡ Technologies Used
- React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.

- Redux: State management to handle email data and user authentication.

- WebSockets: Real-time communication between frontend and backend.

- Axios: HTTP client for API calls (if required for non-real-time features)
